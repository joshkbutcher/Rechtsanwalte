What I did: 
The client wanted their original website to be more responsive without changing the look of their current design. I changed everything from a fixed size to a fluid size, so images and text would fit in the user's screen without having to scroll horizontally. The navigation bar changes to a mobile nav bar on mobile size screens. This was done with CSS and Javascript.
